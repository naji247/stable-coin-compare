<p> Welcome to our blog! We appreciate your time and attention and sincerely hope that you will be able to take away
    something useful from reading this. In this inaugural blog post, we will explain our thoughts on stablecoins: where
    the space currently is at, what the future holds, and how we see our website fitting into the big picture.</p>
<h3>Stablecoins: In Theory</h3>
<p>Stablecoins are a relatively recent innovation to the cryptocurrency space and have been a product of many of the
    lessons learned from the first several years of cryptocurrencies being in existence. Describing what stablecoins
    are is straightforward enough: they are cryptocurrencies that aim to maintain a fixed price (e.g. $1.00).
    Explaining how they work is more complicated. For more information on that we have put together a relatively brief
    explanation <a href="/knowledge-base">here</a>. Even more challenging is putting the rise of stablecoins into
    context in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. </p>

<p>At their core, stablecoins are a compromise between the two major forces at play in shaping the cryptocurrency
    space: ideology and practicality. Stablecoins are a departure from the radically libertarian bent of
    cryptocurrencies to transcend the use of fiat currencies entirely and replace the US Dollar, the Federal Reserve,
    and the global monetary system at large with a new monetary system based entirely on something new. Commitment to
    this ideology has proven to be a liability for the adoption of cryptocurrencies as the dependence of the economy on
    the current monetary system is deeply entrenched. The resulting inertia has limited the real world applications of
    cryptocurrencies. The economic advantages of clearing on the blockchain simply cannot not outweigh the operational
    overhead and risks of transacting in an entirely new currency, especially given its extreme price volatility. </p>

<p>By tying the value of a cryptocurrency to fiat currencies instead of trying to replace them, stablecoins can address
    the issue of practicality. Stablecoins would have the same immediate economic function as - and therefore can be
    used interchangeably with - fiat currencies, eliminating many of the issues that would otherwise be associated with
    using cryptocurrencies. Consequently, the decision of whether to use stablecoins or fiat comes down to a matter of
    which transaction clearing infrastructure is faster and less expensive, an area in which the blockchain excels. </p>

<p>Even though stablecoins take a step back in ideology, they still embody many of the principles of cryptocurrencies.
    By allowing real-world transactions to clear on a decentralized blockchain, stablecoins offer a compelling
    alternative to the existing financial services industry, which is often characterized as an oligopoly that lacks
    sufficient competition to incentivize proper innovation, an inevitable consequence of being too centralized. In
    fact, by being more immediately viable than other long-term cryptocurrency designs, stablecoins represent a more
    direct competitive threat to the status quo and are well postured to effect positive change on this very important
    aspect of the economy.</p>
<h3>Stablecoins: In Practice</h3>
<p>Despite the vast potential of stablecoins to streamline how capital flows throughout the economy, the reality of the
    situation is that the stablecoin space is still very much in its infancy. There are only a handful of stablecoins
    that are currently live (several have recently been released and many more are on currently in development). Many
    of the live projects are based on relatively primitive protocols as they are backed by fiat-collateral and are
    managed by a centralized organization, essentially sacrificing ideological consistency with the fundamental
    principles of cryptocurrencies to release a stablecoin product as expediently as possible. For example, the
    dominant early leader in the stablecoin space, <a href="/coins/tether">Tether</a> is operated by a centralized
    organization, and there is already substantial criticism of its transparency and allegations of market
    manipulation, which are
    incidentally the exact issues decentralization was intended to address. There are more ambitious stablecoin
    projects such as <a href="/coins/dai">MakerDao</a> and <a href="/coins/basis">Basis</a> that aim to maintain price
    stabilization with decentralized protocols, but they are still in relatively early stages as the complexity of the
    protocols naturally
    results in a longer design cycle and a slower adoption rate.</p>

<p>Currently, the vast majority of the use cases of stablecoins are related to facilitating cryptocurrency trading.
    Stablecoins solve many of the operational challenges of trading into cash positions since clearing off-blockchain
    fiat transactions is substantially slower and more onerous than the corresponding on-blockchain cryptocurrency
    transactions. With stablecoins, cryptocurrency traders are able to execute trades faster and more efficiently,
    which is a compelling reason to use stablecoins in lieu of fiat, even if most existing options are not quite
    optimally designed. </p>
<h3>Stablecoins: In the Future:</h3>
<p>Given that stablecoins are still in such an early phase of development and adoption, there is still a substantial
    amount of potential to be realized. The use cases of stablecoins extend far beyond the reach of facilitating the
    cryptocurrency trading. Based on the speed of clearing and the unit economics of each transaction on the
    blockchain, stablecoins represent a compelling alternative to a broad spectrum of financial services ranging from
    checking accounts, point-of-sale services like credit cards, and peer-to-peer payments like Venmo and PayPal. These
    applications can be competitive with existing options because a decentralized architecture has fundamental
    advantages over the centralized paradigm of the status quo. In the long run, better and cheaper transaction
    clearing services will eventually subsume the less efficient options that are currently used. </p>

<p>However, this future of stablecoins being actively competitive with fiat currencies is by no means inevitable, and
    it definitely cannot be taken for granted. There remains a substantial amount of work that must be done to make the
    stablecoin ecosystem truly competitive with the fiat currencies. While most contemporary efforts are focused on
    developing the core stabilization technology, there will soon be promising opportunities to build full-service
    end-to-end applications of stablecoins that provide the same financial services that are currently offered for fiat
    currency once the underlying infrastructure has been established. After all, the industries that stablecoins are
    poised to disrupt have had a considerable head start in developing application-layer technology, which is ground
    that the stablecoin ecosystem will have to cover to match and hopefully surpass the fiat currency system.</p>
<h3>How Stablecoin Compare fits into all of this</h3>
<p>As the domain of stablecoins continues to mature and evolve, knowledge sharing is crucial. Our mission with
    Stablecoin Compare is to coalesce all of the valuable empirical information that is observed on stablecoins into a
    conveniently accessible location for use by adopters, investors, developers, traders, and whoever else may be
    involved in bringing this new technology into the mainstream. Given where we currently are in the development and
    adoption curve, there remain many questions yet to answer about which stablecoin implementations are the most
    effective. There are many design decisions that go into developing each stabilization protocol, and these decisions
    will ultimately determine how closely each stablecoinâ€™s price dynamics will adhere to its peg. It is our intention
    with Stablecoin Compare to track these design decision differences between different stablecoin projects and to
    measure empirical metrics on how successful each stablecoin is at maintaining price stability. Our hope is that our
    users can use this to make more informed decisions about which specific stablecoins implementations to use, invest
    in, or develop applications on top of. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>For a long time now, Tether has enjoyed its place as the dominant stablecoin. Traders looking for a more convenient
    medium of transferring liquidity into and out of their positions did not need to look any further than this novel
    cryptocurrency that pegged its value to the US Dollar by being backed one-for-one by US Dollar deposits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, due to persistent problems stemming from the lack of transparency of the organization operating Tether, the
    stablecoin has received substantial criticism. Chief among these concerns is the question of whether there really
    are enough dollars held in reserve to back <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-review-claims-crypto-asset-fully-backed-theres-catch/">all
        of the virtual stablecoins in existence</a>
    . There are also concerns about Tether issuance was used to manipulate
    the price of Bitcoin. The evidence put forth by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3195066">this
        academic paper</a>
    (which is definitely worth a read) suggests that uncollateralized Tether tokens were
    printed to push up the price Bitcoins to drive more interest in Bitcoin trading. Given Tether’s deep ties to
    Bitfinex, there was an economic incentive to do so as Bitfinex stands to earn additional trading revenue when more
    people are interested in trading Bitcoin. Without the proper oversight or accountability, Tether was able to
    obfuscate any such actions and publicly maintain that its Tether token issuance was fully backed by fiat
    collateral. Despite these troubling issues, the lack of popular alternative options for stablecoins at the time
    meant that Tether was able to continue to dominate the stablecoin space despite these issues. </p>

<p>This may no longer be the case. As a first mover, Tether demonstrated the value proposition of stablecoins, and many
    competing exchanges took notice of its meteoric rise. Its growth from nothing to one of the most popular altcoins
    with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">a market cap over $2B</a>
    indicated that there was a clearly defined need for a utility token that had the same
    economic function as a dollar but could be transacted on the blockchain with fewer frictions than fiat currency.
</p>

<p>Not wanting to be left in the dust by Bitfinex and recognizing that were substantial unresolved issues with Tether,
    other exchanges began developing their own implementations of stablecoins. Coinbase and Circle partnered to launch
    <a href="/coins/usdc">USD Coin</a>, while Gemini launched
    <a href="/coins/geminidollar">Gemini Dollar</a>. Another two competing
    stablecoins, <a href="/coins/paxos">Paxos Standard</a> and <a href="https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd/">TrueUSD</a>,
    were also introduced though by organizations without direct ties to exchanges. For the most part, these competing
    stablecoins share many design principles with Tether: they are
    <a href="/knowledge-base/fiat">fiat-collateralized</a> and are therefore relatively straightforward to set up, especially with
    the backing of an exchange to invest the necessary capital to get the projects off the ground. This does however
    comes at a cost of having to sacrifice the ideological principles of cryptocurrency since a fiat-collateralized
    stablecoin will necessarily require a centralized organization to manage the fiat deposits. For more can be
    contrasted with other stablecoin projects such as <a href="/coins/dai">MakerDao</a> and <a href="/coins/dai">Basis</a>
    which aim to
    maintain price stability in a decentralized way. </p>

<p>Because there are relatively so few degrees of freedom in how a fiat-collateralized stablecoin is implemented - the
    concept of holding fiat currency in a reserve deposit to back one-for-one every single stablecoin token in
    existence is fairly straightforward - many of these new projects have sought to differentiate themselves in other
    dimensions. In particular, these new projects have honed in on one of the most glaring issues of Tether and have
    proposed significantly more transparent governance structures. For example here are excerpts from some official
    descriptions regarding monthly audits:</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.paxos.com/standard/">Paxos</a> - "Nationally top-ranking auditing firm Withum performs
    attestations (using standards established by
    the AICPA)
    on these accounts and the PAX tokens on a month-end basis to ensure they are consistent.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="https://gemini.com/dollar/">Gemini</a> - "The U.S. dollar deposit balance is examined monthly by
    BPM, LLP, a registered public accounting firm, in
    order to verify the 1:1 peg. All Independent Accountants' Reports are published and available here."</blockquote>

<p>What does all of this mean for Tether though? After all, Tether has the advantage of incumbency, making it a
    formidable opponent to overcome. Nevertheless, there are early signs that Tether is under pressure from the
    competition</p>
<h3>A Broken Peg</h3>
<p>One of the most striking things to have come out of the last several weeks was Tether exchange rate away deviating
    away from its $1.00 peg. Significant selling pressure out of Tether pushed the price of Tether in fiat dollars to
    dip below $0.85 at <a href="https://www.ccn.com/lack-of-transparency-to-blame-for-tethers-loss-of-usd-peg-novogratz/">one
        point</a>. Even after retracing most of the decline still continued to trade a substantial 2-3% discount for
    several days. The magnitude and persistence of this price discount was reflective of a collective lack of
    confidence of there being enough dollars held in reserve to meet all of the redemption requests, much like a bank
    run. Tether owners were at one point so concerned that there would not be enough dollars in reserve to redeem their
    tokens at face value that they preferred to sell their stablecoins for a discount. </p>

<p>Tether quickly identified this as an existential threat to their stablecoin project and have responded in kind by <a
        href="https://www.ccn.com/usd-pegged-cryptocurrency-tether-returns-to-dollar-parity-as-supply-sinks/">burning
        $500 million</a>
    of Tether reserves held in their treasury. So far, the response to the exchange rate crisis
    has mostly proven to be effective as the selling pressure has for the most part subsided and the spread between
    Tether’s exchange rate and its $1.00 peg has all but disappeared . While it was not the catastrophic collapse of
    the Tether project that many traders had feared, these events have demonstrated that Tether is not invincible and
    brought to the light many Tether-specific issues such as its lack of transparency. So the broken peg did not bring
    about the ultimate demise of Tether, but these events have shaken its users and have emboldened its competitors. If
    these new competing tokens are to truly overcome Tether, it will have to be in a long, drawn-out war of attrition,
    which we can measure with other metrics. </p>
<h3>Market Capitalization Rotation</h3>
<p>While the selling-induced price pressure has by now proven to be transient, there have been lasting effects on
    Tether that can be observed. After all, many of the people selling out of Tether tokens were not looking to get
    back into Tether after the implosion risk subsided. This manifested as a decline in the market capitalization of
    Tether. Over the course of the month of October, the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">market
        cap</a>
    of Tether has fallen by a third of its original value from about $2.8B to $1.8B. </p>
<img style="width: 100%" src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/stablecoincompare-images/tether-mkt-cap.png">
<p>Looking at the data, it is reasonable to attribute a substantial amount of the selling to a rotation into these new
    stablecoins. People who previously had use for Tether appear to have found Paxos Standard, Gemini Dollar, TrueUSD,
    and USDC worthy alternatives for their purposes and have been significantly inflowing capital into these
    alternative stablecoins. Looking at the market capitalization of these new coins, it is clear that they are <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/race-replace-tether-crypto-stablecoin-charts/">taking
        away part of the market share </a>
    that was previously dominated by Tether. </p>

<p>This has some serious long-term implications about the future of Tether. After all, the stablecoin space is strongly
    governed by network effects, from which Tether has benefitted for a long time as the dominant stablecoin. However,
    that position is now called into question by the rapid fragmentation of the stablecoin market into a number of
    distinct projects. This could potentially have troubling second-order consequences on the future of Tether. If the
    last several weeks have shown that even with substantial network effects, Tether was still unable to justify its
    preferability over its competitors, then now that the network effects are diminished, the case for using Tether
    will be even less compelling. </p>
<h3>Volume</h3>
<p>In addition to market capitalization, it is also possible to measure the success of Paxos, Standard, Gemini Dollar,
    TrueUSD, and USD Coin against Tether by looking at the volume of transactions in each stablecoin. Because the
    primary use case of these fiat-collateralized stablecoins is to facilitate trading on exchanges, the success of
    each coin should correlate with the amount of transactions that occur in each coin. The empirical observations are
    consistent with the market capitalization observations as these new stablecoins have also carved out a proportion
    of trading volume away from the concentration in Tether. Both in terms of on-exchange transaction volumes and
    blockchain transaction volumes, the new stablecoins have made <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/race-replace-tether-crypto-stablecoin-charts/">quite
        the entrance</a>.</p>
<h3>Zero-Sum Game or Has the Pie Become Larger?</h3>
<p>Analysis on the competition between stablecoins tends to frame the situation as being a zero-sum game between the
    competing implementations, and so far this piece has been no exception. While there certainly has been evidence
    that Tether users redeemed their Tether tokens to put into Paxos, Gemini Dollar, and USDC, there is also a
    compelling case to be made that the introduction of these new stablecoins may have actually grown the stablecoin
    pie and have encouraged new users to join the stablecoin ecosystem. This can occur in a number of ways:</p>

<p>One example would be potential stablecoin users who have a use for stablecoins but were hesitant to buy into the
    Tether ecosystem because of the issues relating to the transparency of its operating organization. Now that there
    are more transparent alternatives, these individuals may finally be comfortable with executing transactions in
    stablecoins.</p>

<p>Additionally, because of Tether’s deep ties Bitfinex, it is only available in some exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, Kraken,
    Poloniex). There are many competing exchanges with substantial trading volumes that did not have access to Tether
    such as Coinbase and Gemini. However now that exchange-backed coins like USD Coin and Gemini Dollar have been
    released, there is a whole new set of traders that now can access stablecoins without necessarily detracting from
    Tether’s user base</p>

<p>So far this narrative does not particularly strong empirical evidence in support of it. The aggregate market cap of
    all stablecoins is still down from before these introduction of these new stablecoins (likely due to the burning of
    uncollateralized Tether tokens). However, these could be transient effects, it would not be crazy to believe that
    the overall stablecoin domain will benefit in the long run from the introduction of additional competition to
    provide the best possible fiat-collateralized stablecoin service. </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The short answer to the initial question of whether these new stablecoins will bring about the demise of Tether is
    no, Tether will be around to fight another day. These new coins have significantly eaten into Tether’s unchallenged
    supremacy as king stablecoin, but there is still a lot yet to be seen about how the stablecoin space evolves. </p>
